Startup Idea: I want to start a portable rage room where we load equipment in a Uhaul and go to places such as companies, schools, or birthday parties and set up a tent and a tarp where employees, students, or kids can have fun destroying stuff. Instead of going to a normal rage room the rage rrom comes to you and we call it Rage on the run
Feedback: I would rate this idea a 6 out of 10. 

Pros:
1. Unique concept of a portable rage room that can cater to various events and locations.
2. Potential for a fun and cathartic experience for participants.
3. Offers a unique way to de-stress and let off steam.

Cons:
1. Safety concerns regarding the destruction of items and potential harm to participants.
2. Limited scalability due to the logistical challenges of transporting equipment and setting up at various locations.
3. Sustainability may be an issue, as the novelty of the concept may wear off quickly.

Overall, while the idea is creative and can be appealing, there are some significant challenges that need to be addressed to ensure its success in the long run.

Feedback:
I would rate this idea a 7 out of 10. The concept of a portable rage room is unique and has the potential to attract a wide range of customers. Offering a mobile service could provide convenience and flexibility for customers who may not have easy access to a traditional rage room. However, there may be logistical challenges associated with setting up and moving equipment to different locations. Additionally, safety and liability considerations should be carefully addressed when offering a service that involves physical destruction of items. Overall, with the right planning and execution, this idea has the potential to be successful.
